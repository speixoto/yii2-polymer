     *  - standard: The header is a step above the panel. The header will consume the panel at the point of entry,
     * preventing it from passing through to the opposite side.
     *  - seamed: The header is presented as seamed with the panel.
     *  - waterfall: Similar to standard mode, but header is initially presented as seamed with panel, but then
     * separates to form the step.
     *  - waterfall-tall: The header is initially taller (tall class is added to the header). As the user scrolls,
     * the header separates (forming an edge) while condensing (tall class is removed from the header).
     *  - scroll: The header keeps its seam with the panel, and is pushed off screen.
     *  - cover: The panel covers the whole core-header-panel including the header. This allows user to style the panel
     * in such a way that the panel is partially covering the header.
